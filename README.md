# Getting started

To get the Node server running locally:

- Clone this repository
- `npm install` to install all required dependecies
- Install Redis and run the redis server
- Edit `src/config/redisConfig.ts` with the redis host and port to connect
- `npm run dev` to start the local server

Alternately, to quick try this out in the cloud, check the live API docs: [https://leagues-challenge.herokuapp.com/api-docs](https://leagues-challenge.herokuapp.com/api-docs)
